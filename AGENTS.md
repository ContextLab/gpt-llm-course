# Build GPT Assignment Repository

**Parent:** [llm-course](https://github.com/ContextLab/llm-course) (see main AGENTS.md)

## Overview

Assignment 5 template repository for PSYC 51.17. Students implement and train a small GPT model from scratch.

## Structure

```
gpt-llm-course/
├── Assignment5_GPT.ipynb  # Template notebook (has Colab badge)
├── LICENSE                # License file
└── AGENTS.md              # This file
```

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Assignment5_GPT.ipynb` | Student-facing notebook with Colab badge |

## Conventions

- Notebook opens in Colab via badge at top
- Students fork via GitHub Classroom, not direct clone
- Requires GPU runtime in Colab for training

## Anti-Patterns

- Don't commit solution code to this repo (template only)
- Don't include pre-trained weights (students train from scratch)
