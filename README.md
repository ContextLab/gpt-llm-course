**Timeline: 1 Week**

## Overview

In this capstone-style assignment, you will build a GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model from the ground up and train it to generate text. This assignment goes beyond using pre-trained models—you will implement the core components of a transformer architecture, understand how autoregressive language modeling works, and gain deep insights into what makes modern large language models tick.

This is a **1-week assignment** designed to be ambitious yet achievable with modern GenAI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot) to assist with implementation, debugging, and optimization.

GPT models are decoder-only transformers that have revolutionized natural language processing. By building one yourself, you'll understand the intricate details of self-attention mechanisms, positional encodings, layer normalization, and the training dynamics that enable these models to generate coherent text.

This is an ambitious assignment that will challenge you to think deeply about architecture design, optimization, and evaluation. However, with modern tools and GenAI assistance, it's entirely achievable—and incredibly rewarding.
## Learning Objectives

By the end of this assignment, you will be able to:

1. **Implement transformer architecture components** including multi-head self-attention, feed-forward networks, layer normalization, and residual connections
2. **Understand autoregressive language modeling** and how GPT models generate text one token at a time
3. **Implement causal (masked) self-attention** to ensure the model can only attend to previous tokens
4. **Design and implement positional encodings** to give the model a sense of token position
5. **Build a complete training pipeline** including data loading, batching, loss computation, and optimization
6. **Apply different text generation strategies** including greedy decoding, temperature sampling, top-k, and nucleus (top-p) sampling
7. **Analyze what the model has learned** by visualizing attention patterns and token embeddings
8. **Compare your model's performance** with established models like GPT-2
9. **Understand the trade-offs** between model size, training time, and generation quality

## Background

### The Transformer Architecture

The transformer architecture, introduced in the seminal paper "Attention is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017), revolutionized sequence modeling by replacing recurrent neural networks with self-attention mechanisms. GPT uses only the decoder portion of the transformer, removing the cross-attention layers used in encoder-decoder models.

### Key Components

**Self-Attention**: The core mechanism that allows each token to attend to all previous tokens (in the case of GPT, due to causal masking). The attention mechanism computes:

```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / sqrt(d_k))V
```

**Multi-Head Attention**: Instead of a single attention mechanism, GPT uses multiple attention heads in parallel, each learning different types of relationships between tokens.

**Causal Masking**: Unlike BERT (which uses bidirectional attention), GPT applies a causal mask during attention computation to ensure that when predicting token *i*, the model can only attend to tokens at positions *j < i*. This makes the model autoregressive.

**Position Encodings**: Since the attention mechanism is position-agnostic, we must explicitly encode position information. This can be done with sinusoidal encodings (as in the original paper) or learned embeddings (as in GPT).

**Feed-Forward Networks**: After attention, each position is processed by a position-wise feed-forward network (two linear transformations with a non-linearity in between).

**Layer Normalization and Residual Connections**: These help with training stability and gradient flow through deep networks.

### The GPT Family

- **GPT** (Radford et al., 2018): Demonstrated that pre-training + fine-tuning works well for NLP
- **GPT-2** (Radford et al., 2019): Showed that larger models with more data can perform well zero-shot
- **GPT-3** (Brown et al., 2020): Scaled to 175B parameters and exhibited impressive few-shot learning
- **GPT-4** and beyond: Continued scaling with improved architectures and training techniques

## Your Task

You will implement, train, and analyze a GPT-style model. The assignment is divided into several interconnected tasks:

### 1. Implement Transformer Components

Build the core components of the GPT architecture:

**a) Multi-Head Self-Attention with Causal Masking**
- Implement the scaled dot-product attention mechanism
- Add causal masking to prevent attention to future tokens
- Support multiple attention heads
- Include dropout for regularization

**b) Position-wise Feed-Forward Network**
- Implement a two-layer MLP with GELU or ReLU activation
- Typically expands to 4x the model dimension and back

**c) Positional Encoding**
- Implement either learned positional embeddings (like GPT) or sinusoidal encodings (like the original Transformer)
- Justify your choice

**d) Transformer Block**
- Combine attention and feed-forward layers with residual connections and layer normalization
- Consider whether to use pre-norm or post-norm architecture

**e) GPT Model**
- Stack multiple transformer blocks
- Add token embedding layer
- Add final linear layer to project to vocabulary size
- Implement the forward pass with causal language modeling objective

### 2. Implement the Training Pipeline

**a) Data Preparation**
- Choose a dataset (see suggestions below)
- Implement tokenization (you can use a pre-built tokenizer like GPT-2's BPE)
- Create data loaders with proper batching
- Handle variable-length sequences appropriately

**b) Training Loop**
- Implement the cross-entropy loss for language modeling
- Use AdamW optimizer with learning rate scheduling (consider cosine decay with warmup)
- Implement gradient clipping to prevent instability
- Track training and validation loss
- Save model checkpoints

**c) Hyperparameter Selection**
- Justify your choices for:
  - Model size (number of layers, hidden dimension, number of heads)
  - Batch size and sequence length
  - Learning rate and schedule
  - Dropout rates
  - Training steps/epochs

### 3. Generate Text with Multiple Sampling Strategies

Implement and compare different text generation methods:

**a) Greedy Decoding**: Always pick the most likely next token

**b) Temperature Sampling**: Sample from the probability distribution with adjustable temperature (higher = more random)

**c) Top-k Sampling**: Sample from only the k most likely tokens

**d) Nucleus (Top-p) Sampling**: Sample from the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds p

Generate samples with each method and analyze the quality, diversity, and coherence of the outputs. What works best for your model and dataset?

### 4. Analyze Learned Representations

**a) Attention Pattern Visualization**
- Extract and visualize attention weights from different layers and heads
- Analyze what patterns different heads learn (e.g., do some attend to previous token, to same word type, to syntactic patterns?)
- Create visualizations showing attention patterns for interesting examples

**b) Token Embedding Analysis**
- Extract the learned token embeddings
- Visualize them in 2D/3D space using UMAP or t-SNE
- Identify clusters and analyze which tokens are embedded close together
- Does the model learn meaningful semantic relationships?

**c) Probing Tasks (Optional)**
- Design simple probing classifiers to test what linguistic information is encoded in the representations
- Examples: POS tagging, syntactic dependencies, semantic relationships

### 5. Compare with Pre-trained Models

**a) Load a Pre-trained Model**
- Load a comparable pre-trained model (e.g., GPT-2 small, DistilGPT-2)
- Ensure fair comparison (similar size, similar data domain if possible)

**b) Quantitative Comparison**
- Compare perplexity on a held-out test set
- Compare generation quality using metrics like:
  - Perplexity
  - Self-BLEU (for diversity)
  - Human evaluation (optional but recommended)

**c) Qualitative Analysis**
- Generate text from the same prompts with both models
- Analyze differences in coherence, creativity, factual accuracy, and fluency
- What are the strengths and weaknesses of your model?

### 6. Dataset Selection

Choose one of the following datasets or propose your own:

**a) Code Generation**
- Python code from GitHub (filtered for quality)
- Allows you to build a code-generation model
- Can evaluate on code completion tasks

**b) Stories/Creative Writing**
- WritingPrompts dataset from Reddit
- Children's stories
- Fan fiction or short stories

**c) Domain-Specific Text**
- Scientific papers (arXiv abstracts)
- News articles
- Wikipedia articles
- Poetry or song lyrics

**d) Dialogue**
- Movie scripts
- Reddit conversations
- Chat logs (appropriately anonymized)

**e) Shakespeare or Classic Literature**
- Smaller dataset but rich language
- Good for initial testing and rapid iteration

Choose a dataset that interests you and that's appropriate for the model size you can feasibly train. Remember: you don't need billions of tokens to build something impressive!

## Implementation Options

You have flexibility in how you approach this assignment:

### Option 1: From Scratch (Recommended for Deep Learning)

Implement everything from first principles using PyTorch or JAX:
- Full control over every component
- Deepest learning experience
- More time-intensive but most rewarding

### Option 2: Using nanoGPT as a Starting Point

Andrej Karpathy's [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) provides a clean, minimal implementation:
- Start with the codebase and understand every line
- Modify and extend it for your needs
- Add analysis and visualization components
- Good balance of learning and efficiency

### Option 3: Using HuggingFace Transformers

Use the HuggingFace library but implement key components yourself:
- Use their data loading and training utilities
- Implement your own attention mechanism or transformer block
- Focus more on experiments and analysis
- Faster to get results but less deep implementation experience

**Whichever option you choose, you must demonstrate deep understanding of how the model works. Simply calling library functions without explanation is insufficient.**

## Technical Requirements

- **Vocabulary size** appropriate for your tokenizer (typically 10K-50K)
- **Context window** of at least 128 tokens (256-512 preferred)

### Training Requirements

- Train for enough steps to see meaningful convergence (exact number depends on dataset and model size)
- Monitor both training and validation loss
- Implement early stopping or checkpointing based on validation performance
- Track key metrics: loss, perplexity, tokens/second

## Tips for Success (1-Week Timeline)

1. **Use GenAI aggressively**: Claude, ChatGPT, and GitHub Copilot are your friends. Use them to:
   - Implement transformer components you haven't built before
   - Debug errors and understand PyTorch behavior
   - Write boilerplate code and data processing pipelines
   - Explain unfamiliar concepts or papers
2. **Start small**: Begin with a tiny model (2-4 layers, small hidden size) to debug your implementation quickly
3. **Validate components**: Test each component individually before assembling the full model
4. **Monitor carefully**: Watch for NaN losses, exploding gradients, or other training instabilities
5. **Use gradient clipping**: This prevents exploding gradients in early training
6. **Overfit a small batch first**: Ensure your model can memorize a tiny amount of data before scaling up
7. **Compare with references**: If results seem off, compare your implementation with nanoGPT or other references
8. **Save often**: Checkpointing is critical—you don't want to lose hours of training
9. **Document everything**: Future you (and the grader) will thank you for clear explanations
10. **Have fun**: This is a challenging but incredibly rewarding assignment!
